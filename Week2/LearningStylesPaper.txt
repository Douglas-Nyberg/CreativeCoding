The idea that people have specific learning styles, like hearing (auditory), seeing (visual), or doing (kinesthetic), is popular. However, when we look closely at what really helps us learn, it seems like this learning style idea might not be that important. Research shows that what really matters in learning something well isn't so much about whether you prefer to listen or see information but about how often you review the material and how much time you spend on it.
Studies have found that practicing something a lot and studying for longer periods are key to learning better. This means that, rather than worrying about whether you're a visual or auditory learner, it's more helpful to focus on repeating what you're trying to learn in different ways and making sure you spend enough time on it.
For instance, I've found that testing myself on what I'm trying to learn, using methods like practice tests or flashcards, really works wonders for me. It doesn't really matter if I think I prefer learning by watching videos or listening to lectures; what truly makes a difference is how I interact with the material. By actively engaging with the content, not just passively going over it, I'm able to remember it better. So, for me, the takeaway is clear: I don't spend too much time worrying about whether I'm a visual or auditory learner. Instead, I focus on repeating the material in various ways and dedicating enough time to really get to grips with it. This approach has consistently helped me learn more effectively, regardless of the subject matter.
